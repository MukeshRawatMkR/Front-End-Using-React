# Concepts that I've covered:

- **Component-Driven Architecture**:

  - Building UIs from reusable UI components/elements.
  - React elements are used to make those components.

- **CDN Links**

  - Deliver static files.

- **JSX -> Pure React Code(which is eventually JS Code), this conversion is called transpilation**

  - Transpilation done by -> Babel.

- **set-up the Vite project for React**

  - just we set up the CDN links for React & ReactDOM, if we keep manually adding links like this, for other third party tools as well then we would have a lot of 'src' files and configuration code in our file, which will become messy and eventually all we would see the configuration code in our file not the actual code that we wanna run.
  - for that we use framework/starter/scaffolder.
  - Framework vs scaffolder vs starter: https://chatgpt.com/c/68abfea4-a440-832f-a842-56e20d1222be

- **Component**
  - Just a function, and always start with upper case, otherwise error.
